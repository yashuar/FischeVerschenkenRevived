FischeVerschenkenRevived--

This is a little Project for School. It's supposed to be some kind of Battleships version, where you shoot down randomly placed ships.


This repo is just for keeping changes in sync, if you want to play, you need to build the game in Visual Studio
most of the game is in german, so speaking german is kind of a must

Coded in
Visual Studio
